[Treya-Jumble Wumble Read Me File]
 ================================

Our game is a tool designed to help children with spelling. The evolution of technology is everything in todays society so we need to 
take advantage of the tools we have to teach the younger generations in a fun and positive way. Our app started out with a lot more options…such as a home button and a charts section, but we took out a lot of that because it needed to be straight forward and simple for the little ones.


Actual Code:

-Treya is a combination of Trenton and Aleya in a sort of obvious way. This was a good way to copyright our work without having to put our names out there

-Our launch image was made into our logo because we are focused around helping children and introducing them into todays technological revolution.

-We tried to keep fonts similar and easy to read. They go with our colour scheme aimed towards younger audiences for a "care-free" environment.

-We chose our animations based on other successful child based apps such as apps by pbs, entertainment one, and little tikes. 

-Our game is only ran on IPAD AIRE because on an IPhone a child must squint and the larger words look either bunched together or are to small to read.

-Our Logo was made by tagul and arranged by us. We chose a tree because it represent the tree of knowledge we are sprounting into the child’s mind.

-Our code was not all written by us. We did use snippets from websites that were willing to share without copyright, but it was not anything major and we altered it to be our own.

-Snippets such as the structure of some of the images and we referenced a website for help on making the animation work. We did change everything to our own though. 

Game Play:
-We have arrange the menu by grade

-This alert controller will be brought back up when the player reaches 200 points

-We had an ending for our game, but we felt that the child needed to continue on to the next level or repeat the level(instead of feeling like it was over)

Actual Game Play:
-The levels are made up of common spelling words for each grade. We combined sources to make an efficient list for each grade.

-The sounds played are light and enjoyable for a child

-The twinkling is also a visually pleasing plus side to the game

-When we first put in the timer we had in counting down, but we changed it to counting up because we did not want our users to be stressed about time.
 We'd rather them learn and enjoy the game or just see how fast they can complete the levels.


Process:
-We first checked the internet to get an idea of what type of application we wanted to make

-After three other trys, we landed on Jumble Wumble!

-We thought it would be a good idea since so many young people have issues with spelling and grammar

-We started with the view controllers and then added our images

-After making the grade lists and combining everything we had a functioning app

-We had a lot of trial and error but eventually we had a finished product of Jumble Wumble


Playing:

-The game was meant for little ones from grades 1-5. 

-When playing you first pick your grade, then unjumble the word, and then play until you reach 100 points

-The points are different for 1st grade because the words are shorter. They are equal 10 point a tile where as 2-5 they are worth 5

Instructions:

-pull up game *Notice our launch screen and app icon*

-choose your grade 

-Unjumble the word to spell a common level spelling word
